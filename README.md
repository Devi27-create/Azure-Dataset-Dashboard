# Azure-Dataset-Dashboard

*Introduction*

In this project of Insigh BI Solutions Pvt. Ltd., I first focused on data cleaning using Azure SQL. I utilized a few functions to remove inconsistencies, and formatted the data for better analysis. Once the data was thoroughly cleaned and structured, I moved on to the visualization phase using Power BI. In Power BI, I created a comprehensive report that presents key insights across two distinct pages. The first page highlights the various brands, while the second page provides more detailed breakdowns and visual representations of specific metrics. This approach not only enhances the clarity of the insights but also makes it easier to understand and interpret the findings effectively.

*Azure SQL*

After successfully loading the dataset into Azure, I executed a straightforward SELECT statement to examine the contents. During this process, I discovered some impurities in the 'original price' and 'sales price' columns. It appeared that there were unnecessary question marks preceding both prices, which could potentially lead to inaccuracies in data analysis. To resolve this issue, I updated the table to remove the question marks, ensuring that the values in both the 'original price' and 'sales price' columns were clean and properly formatted.

Once the data was cleaned, I proceeded to connect the Azure SQL Database with Power BI using the database connection option. This process allowed me to create insightful visualizations and reports based on the refined dataset, facilitating deeper analysis and informed decision-making.

# Azure-Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio-PowerBI:

## Azure

**Step 1: Creating & Loading Data to S3 Bucket**

To begin the process, I logged into my Azure account to create a database filling the basic details of server,  Database name, Authentication method and password and clicked on review+create and then on create. once deployment is completed then going to resource I then setted up a server firewall via selecting a Public network and IPv4 address and saved the same.

After this I opened the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and through Database Engine connected the server by providing the User name and Password. Now going back to Azure in Query editor(preview) by providing the same login credentials as I provided in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 

a new S3 bucket. This required me to select S3 as my storage option, which is ideal for scalable cloud storage. After clicking on the "Create Bucket" option, I was prompted to fill in several necessary details like, selected the type of bucket, region (ensuring it matched the region used in Snowflake for seamless integration), and bucket name, which i named as 'tableau.project2e.'

Once the bucket 'tableau.project2e' was successfully created, I proceeded to load my dataset into it. The user-friendly interface allowed me to navigate to the general-purpose bucket settings, where I found the "Upload" button. By clicking on this option, I was prompted to "Add Files," which opened a dialog for me to select the dataset I wanted to upload. After selecting the appropriate files from my local storage, I initiated the upload process, and within moments, my dataset was securely stored in the AWS bucket.

**Step 2: Creating a Role**

Well to facilitate a smooth connection between AWS and Snowflake, it was essential to create a role. I started this process by navigating to the AWS console home page. From there, I explored the "All Services" section and selected IAM (Identity and Access Management), a critical component for managing access permissions. Under the Access Management tab, I clicked on "Roles," then chose the "Create Role" option to begin the role creation process.

The platform guided me through a three-step setup. I carefully filled in the required details at each step, specifying permissions and trust relationships that would govern the connection between AWS and Snowflake. After reviewing my inputs, I successfully created the role, thereby establishing a crucial link for data transfer and processing between the two platforms.

## Snowflake + AWS

**Step 1: Creating The Integration Object & Updating The Trust Policy** 

To begin the process, I navigated to the Home tab in my application, where I proceeded to the Projects section and opened a new worksheet. In this worksheet, I crafted a script to create a storage integration in Snowflake. The code I used is as follows:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE STORAGE INTEGRATION tableau_Integration
TYPE = EXTERNAL_STAGE
STORAGE_PROVIDER = 'S3'
ENABLED = TRUE
STORAGE_AWS_ROLE_ARN = 'arn:aws:iam::124356268240:role/Tableau.Role1ee'
STORAGE_ALLOWED_LOCATIONS = ('s3://tableau.project2e/')
COMMENT = 'Optional Comment'
```

After executing this code, I realized that I needed to update the bucket details to reflect the project specifications accurately. Therefore, I returned to the AWS Management Console, selecting "All Services" and then clicking on “S3” under the Storage category. There, I located the bucket I had previously created and accessed its settings to modify the Storage Allowed Locations to align with the project's name. Additionally, I updated the Storage AWS Role ARN to match the appropriate ARN for the role I intended to use. 

Once these changes were made, I executed the provided code to create the integration object in Snowflake. To verify that everything was set up correctly, I retrieved the details of the integration object using the following command:

```sql
// Description of Integration Object
DESC INTEGRATION tableau_Integration;
```

After confirming the integration's details, I turned my attention to updating the Trust Policy in AWS. I navigated to the IAM Roles section and selected the role associated with the integration. Under the Trust Relationships tab, I clicked on "Edit Trust Policy." 

Here, I meticulously replaced the "AWS" value with the User ARN that I retrieved earlier from executing the Snowflake code. Moreover, I updated the "sts:externalid" value, which I had initially set using arbitrary values, changing it to the specific values provided by Snowflake after executing the integration code. Once all modifications were completed, I clicked on “Update Policy” to save the changes, thereby finalizing the integration and trust relationship setup.

**Step 2: Loading the Data into Snowflake**

Here first of all I wrote a code to create a database naming "tableau," and executed the code. Following that, I created a schema called "tableau_data," which serves as the organizational structure within the database, and executed the corresponding code. After setting up the schema, I proceeded to create a blank table titled "tableau_dataset." This table was designed with columns and their respective data types, tailored to accommodate the specific dataset. The execution of this code, resulted in a properly structured table. Here’s the code I utilized for creating the database, schema, and table:

```sql
CREATE database tableau;

create schema tableau_Data;

create table tableau_dataset (
Household_ID	string,Region	string,Country	string,Energy_Source	string,
Monthly_Usage_kWh	float,Year	int,Household_Size	int,Income_Level	string,
Urban_Rural	string,Adoption_Year	int,Subsidy_Received	string,Cost_Savings_USD float

);
```

Now I needed to create a stage to bring the data into snowflake and for that I wrote another code mentioning the stage name as tableau.tableau_dataset.tableau_stage then the url and storage_integration and then executed this.
-- Code used:
Next, I needed to create a stage to facilitate the data import into Snowflake and for that I wrote a separate code that defined the stage name as "tableau.tableau_Data.tableau_stage," including the necessary URL and storage integration details. After executing this code, the stage was successfully created.

Here’s the code used for this step:

```sql
create stage tableau.tableau_Data.tableau_stage
url = 's3://tableau.project2e'
storage_integration = tableau_Integration
```

After this, I transferred the data from the created stage "tableau_stage" into the "tableau_dataset" table. For this operation, I executed a copy command and ran a select statement to verify that the data loaded correctly into Snowflake.

Here’s the code utilized for copying data and executing the selection:

```sql
copy into tableau_dataset 
from @tableau_stage
file_format = (type=csv field_delimiter=',' skip_header=1 )
on_error = 'continue'

select * from tableau_dataset;
```
This step effectively ensured that the data was accurately imported, and allowed me to view the entries in the "tableau_dataset" table.

**Step 3: Data Transformations** 
After loading the data and gaining a comprehensive understanding of its structure and content, I proceeded to implement several data transformations. To ensure the original dataset remained intact, I created a new table called "energy_consumption". This was accomplished using the following SQL command:

```sql
CREATE TABLE energy_consumption AS SELECT * FROM tableau_dataset;
```

With the new table in place, I focused on transforming the **Monthly_usage_kwh** column. The objective was to adjust the energy consumption values based on income levels. Specifically, I increased the monthly usage by 10% for low-income levels, 20% for middle-income levels, and 30% for high-income levels. The SQL updates for these transformations were executed as follows:

```sql
-- For low income level
UPDATE energy_consumption
SET monthly_usage_kwh = monthly_usage_kwh * 1.1
WHERE income_level = 'Low';

-- For middle income level
UPDATE energy_consumption
SET monthly_usage_kwh = monthly_usage_kwh * 1.2
WHERE income_level = 'Middle';

-- For high income level
UPDATE energy_consumption
SET monthly_usage_kwh = monthly_usage_kwh * 1.3
WHERE income_level = 'High';
```

After implementing these adjustments, I retrieved the updated records with the command:

```sql
SELECT * FROM energy_consumption;
```

In addition to the modifications made to the monthly usage, I also focused on transforming the **Cost_Savings_USD** column. For this adjustment, I aimed to lower the values across all income levels: reducing by 10% for low-income levels, 20% for middle-income levels, and 30% for high-income levels. The corresponding SQL update statements were as follows:

```sql
-- For low income level
UPDATE energy_consumption
SET cost_savings_usd = cost_savings_usd * 0.9
WHERE income_level = 'Low';

-- For middle income level
UPDATE energy_consumption
SET cost_savings_usd = cost_savings_usd * 0.8
WHERE income_level = 'Middle';

-- For high income level
UPDATE energy_consumption
SET cost_savings_usd = cost_savings_usd * 0.7
WHERE income_level = 'High';
```

Finally, I queried the updated table once again to review the changes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM energy_consumption;
```
