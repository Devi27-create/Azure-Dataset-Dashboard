# Azure-Dataset-Dashboard

*Introduction*

In this project of Insigh BI Solutions Pvt. Ltd., I first focused on data cleaning using Azure SQL. I utilized a few functions to remove inconsistencies, and formatted the data for better analysis. Once the data was thoroughly cleaned and structured, I moved on to the visualization phase using Power BI. In Power BI, I created a comprehensive report that presents key insights across two distinct pages. The first page highlights the various brands, while the second page provides more detailed breakdowns and visual representations of specific metrics. This approach not only enhances the clarity of the insights but also makes it easier to understand and interpret the findings effectively.

*Azure SQL*

After successfully loading the dataset into Azure, I executed a straightforward SELECT statement to examine the contents. During this process, I discovered some impurities in the 'original price' and 'sales price' columns. It appeared that there were unnecessary question marks preceding both prices, which could potentially lead to inaccuracies in data analysis. To resolve this issue, I updated the table to remove the question marks, ensuring that the values in both the 'original price' and 'sales price' columns were clean and properly formatted.

Once the data was cleaned, I proceeded to connect the Azure SQL Database with Power BI using the database connection option. This process allowed me to create insightful visualizations and reports based on the refined dataset, facilitating deeper analysis and informed decision-making.
